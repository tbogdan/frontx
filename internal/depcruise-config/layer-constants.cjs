/**
 * Single source of truth for the FrontX SDK layer partitioning.
 *
 * Both the depcruise rules (internal/depcruise-config/*.cjs, consumed by
 * `npm run arch:deps:*`) and the package.json layer guard
 * (scripts/sdk-layer-tests.ts, consumed by `npm run arch:sdk`) derive their
 * layer membership, allowed-edge, and deprecation lists from this module so
 * the two checks cannot diverge.
 *
 * Historically these lists were duplicated across the script and each
 * depcruise config; a change to one layer had to be mirrored by hand in the
 * other, and drift silently weakened one of the two guards. Keeping them here
 * means `arch:sdk` and `arch:deps:*` always agree on what counts as SDK,
 * framework, or a deprecated edge.
