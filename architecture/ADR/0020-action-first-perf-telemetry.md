**ID**: `cpt-frontx-adr-action-first-telemetry`

## Context and Problem Statement
FrontX applications need frontend performance observability for diagnosing slow user interactions, API bottlenecks, and rendering issues. Standard OpenTelemetry Browser SDK instrumentation produces orphan spans (spans without a logical grouping), making per-action performance breakdown impossible. How should we instrument the frontend to guarantee 100% span correlation while maintaining fail-open semantics?

## Decision Drivers
- Every span must belong to a named action for per-action % breakdown
- Telemetry must never crash application business flows (fail-open)
- Vendor-neutral instrumentation (avoid lock-in)
- Local dev visibility without requiring a collector
- L1 SDK (zero @cyberfabric deps) for broad reusability

## Considered Options

1. Action-first OTel with ambient fallback
2. Datadog RUM SDK
3. Custom fetch wrapper only
4. No telemetry

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **Action-first OTel with ambient fallback**, because it provides 100% span correlation across all runtimes that join the shared `globalThis` telemetry registry, through a three-tier resolution algorithm (active scope, recent scope within 2500ms window, ambient fallback) while maintaining vendor-neutral OTel instrumentation and fail-open semantics.

The system is implemented as `@cyberfabric/perf-telemetry` (L1 SDK, zero @cyberfabric deps) with a framework plugin and Studio dev panel. Backend path: Browser -> OTLP/HTTP -> OTel Collector (Docker) -> Datadog APM.

### Consequences

#### Positive

- 100% span correlation across runtimes joined to the shared registry — no orphan spans in Datadog APM for those runtimes
- Per-action performance breakdown (Backend API % + Frontend % + Runtime % + Rendering %)
- Fail-open design — telemetry errors never crash business flows
- Local dev visibility via Studio panel without requiring a collector
- L1 SDK — usable by any React app, not just FrontX
- Cross-runtime convergence: MFE child runtimes join a host-owned `telemetryStore` via `Symbol.for('frontx:telemetry-registry')` on `globalThis`, so Studio sees spans from all participating runtimes (precedent: `sharedFetchCache`)
- Safe-by-default config posture: `enabled: false`, required `serviceName` +
  `collectorUrl` — prevents silent-drop scenarios in deployed environments.
- Per-route CLS reporting — aligns with action-first breakdown (deviates from
  the web-vitals.js page-lifetime convention).

#### Negative

- Ambient actions add span volume (cost in Datadog per-span pricing)
- OTel peer dependencies add ~50KB to bundle when tree-shaken
- Docker collector required for Datadog export (CORS + credential isolation)
- Zone.js dependency via ZoneContextManager for async context propagation
- First-party fetch wrapper trusts caller URL within a same-origin allowlist;
  cross-origin URLs fail-open and invoke `debugLogger('fetch.cross_origin')`.
  SDK consumers are responsible for URL provenance within the same origin.
- Sampling-rejected events do not count toward the rate-limit budget — under
  low sampling rates a lane can process more than `maxEventsPerMinute` calls;
  intentional for collector-cost protection at full-fidelity lanes.
- `onDestroy` flush is best-effort (the plugin contract is synchronous);
  fast-shutdown scenarios may drop in-flight spans.

### Confirmation

Decision confirmed by:
- All spans in Datadog APM have `action.name` attribute (verified via telemetry validation tools)
- `npm run validate:telemetry` passes (lint, contract check, smoke test)
- Studio dev panel shows live span data with action correlation
- Disabling collector does not affect application business flows (fail-open verified)
- Vitest suite in `packages/perf-telemetry/src/__tests__/` covers policy
  engine sampling/rate-limit interaction, StrictMode double-emit guards, and
  config defaults.
- Smoke validator asserts `route.navigation` emits exactly once per
  navigation.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Action-First OTel with Ambient Fallback

- Good: 100% correlation guarantee, no orphan spans
- Good: Standard OTel vendor-neutral instrumentation
- Good: Fail-open — no business impact from telemetry failures
- Good: Local dev panel without collector
- Bad: Ambient actions add span volume
- Bad: OTel peer deps add ~50KB bundle size

### Datadog RUM SDK

- Good: Managed SDK with built-in dashboard
- Bad: Vendor lock-in to Datadog
- Bad: No action-first correlation model
- Bad: No local dev panel capability

### Custom Fetch Wrapper Only

- Good: Minimal code, no OTel dependency
- Bad: No automatic correlation for web vitals, long tasks
- Bad: No ambient fallback — orphan spans inevitable
- Bad: No standardized trace hierarchy

### No Telemetry

- Good: Zero complexity, zero bundle cost
- Bad: 2-4 hour diagnosis time per performance incident
- Bad: No data-driven performance optimization possible
